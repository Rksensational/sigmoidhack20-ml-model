Suicides Data Analysis in India Using Machine Learning

Close to 800 000 people die by suicide every year. Suicides are preventable.If somehow we collect all data we definitely find the common reasons for suicides and stop this & save people's life.

1. Suicide is the act of taking one’s own life & Suicidal behavior refers to talking about or taking actions related to ending one’s own life.
2. Close to 800 000 people die by suicide every year. Furthermore, for each suicide, there are more than 20 suicide attempts.
3.Suicides are preventable you should seek immediate assistance from a healthcare provider.

## What it does

This is a machine learning model that reads data from the dataset and shows results on the top reasons why people committed suicide and etc.

## How I built it

I used a few models i.e. algorithms of classification, prediction, linear regression.

## Challenges I ran into

Data collection is the biggest challenge for me.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I had no knowledge and idea about machine learning and data science before, but I started to understand it while working and I starting loving this & this is an accomplishment that I'm proud of.

## What I learned

1. Data is king.
2. Machine learning is not all about maths it also requires logical and analytical skills.

## What's next for Suicides Data Analysis in India Using Machine Learning

Almost 11,89,068 human beings dedicated suicide in 2012 alone, it's miles pretty crucial to apprehend why they dedicate suicide and attempt to mitigate.
If somehow we are able to collect all data we definitely find the common reasons for suicides and will try to stop also & save people life.
